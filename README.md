# GUI-Quanstapp-using-Tkinter-Library
This code makes a GUI (Graphic User Interface) which was helpful for making the proceedings of the Sales team at Quantsapp Pvt. Ltd. easier. Prior to this GUI, the Sales team used Excel and Google Sheets for Data entry (call records). Now, the same process can be done in a much easier way using this code.
